# BERT NLP – Banking and Financial Text Analysis Use Case

## Overview
This project demonstrates the application of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for natural language processing tasks within banking and financial system contexts. The focus is on analysing and classifying textual data to support intelligent decision-making, risk awareness, and information extraction.

The project explores how transformer-based models can be applied to structured and unstructured text commonly found in financial environments, such as customer communications, transactional descriptions, and operational records.

## Problem Context
Financial and insurance systems handle large volumes of text-based data that require:
- Accurate interpretation
- Secure processing
- Consistent classification
- Reduced manual intervention

This project investigates how NLP models can assist in improving efficiency, accuracy, and insight generation from textual data while maintaining data integrity.

## Key Capabilities
- Text preprocessing and tokenization
- Context-aware text representation using BERT
- Classification of financial or banking-related text
- Feature extraction for downstream decision logic

## Relevance to Financial & Insurance Systems
Natural Language Processing solutions such as BERT can support:
- Fraud and phishing detection
- Customer query classification
- Risk and compliance text analysis
- Automated document and communication review
- Intelligent support systems for operations and security teams

## Technologies Used
- BERT (Transformer-based NLP model)
- Python
- Natural Language Processing techniques
- Data preprocessing and model evaluation

## Security & Data Considerations
The project emphasizes responsible handling of text data and highlights the importance of:
- Secure data preprocessing
- Avoidance of sensitive data exposure
- Ethical use of machine learning in financial systems

## Notes
This project focuses on analytical and model-based text understanding. While implemented as a standalone prototype, the concepts can be integrated into backend services, APIs, or cloud-based platforms to support secure and scalable financial applications.
